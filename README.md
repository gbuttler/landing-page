I am going to create a basic website using HTML, CSS and Flexbox.
The topic will be about sewing and different projects.


1. I have mapped out the website with all of the HTML information and text.
2. Sourced and added images. All my own except the vintage sewing maching (Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Annie Spratt</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/hzdgFPz1V24?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
